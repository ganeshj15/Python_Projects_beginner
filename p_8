# BMI calculator
"""
The Body Mass Index or BMI is calculated from weight and height of a Person.
The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individual’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, then dividing the answer again by their height.
Now let’s see how to create a BMI calculator:
"""

height = float(input("Enter your height in cm:"))
height = height/100
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg:"))
BMI = weight / (height * height)
print("Your Body Mass Index is:", BMI)
if BMI > 0:
	if BMI <= 16:
		print("you are severely underweight")
	elif BMI <= 18.5:
		print("you are underweight")
	elif BMI <= 25:
		print("you are healthy")
	elif BMI <= 30:
		print("you are overweight")
	else:
		print("you are severely overweight")
else:
	print("enter valid details")
